# HTML CSS Basics course

## Topic
Basic HTML / CSS course for coworkers

## Contents
This repository contains support materials for a basic HTML/CSS course that we organize at our company. 

## Reason for this course
The initiative for this course sprung from the amount of questions that arise around our CMS. These questions are small and usually about HTML, and indirectly about CSS and Bootstrap. More HTML knowledge for non-IT employees will hopefully save the IT-team time on the shorter and longer run.

## Goals of this course
The participants of this course:
- can apply the basics of HTML;
- can solve basic HTML issues by themselves;
- have knowledge of the basics of CSS and Bootstrap;
- can use the company CMS by following these guidelinws:
    - Check correct usage of tags;
    - Copy-paste materials and modify them in a clean way;
    - Stick to the HTML basics and leave most enhancing features (e.g. applying colors and spacing) to us;

## Requirements for employees who take the course
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    - Windows & Mac: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- VS Code Extensions (once Visual Studio Code is installed, find them under cubicle-looking-logo in the panel on the left)
    - Live Server (by Ritwick Dey)
    - HTMLHint (by Mike Kaufman)
- Connection to the company OneDrive folder

## Good to know
The 'Exercises-complete' folder contains files that will be put at participants disposal throughout the course. This will allow everyone to start with the same (complete) file at every new topic or chapter.
